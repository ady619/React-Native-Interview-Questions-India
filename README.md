1. #What is React Native?

    React native is an open-source JavaScript framework designed by Facebook for native mobile applications development. It is based on a JavaScript library-React.
    
    React Native saves your development time as it enables you to build real and native mobile apps within a single language – JavaScript for both Android and iOS platforms, such that code once, run that on any platform, and the React Native App is ready for use with native look and feel.

3. ### Why use React Native?

    There is the following list of React Native features behind its use:
    - Easy to use.
    - Open-source framework
    - Cross-platform compatibility
    - Code Sharing
    - Use a common language – JavaScript for cross-platform development.
    - Faster Development
    - Saves Time and efforts
    - Gives Native look and feel

4. ### What are the advantages of React Native?

    - React Native is based on “Learn Once Write Everywhere” approach to equip developers with a tool that only needs to be learned once, just in a single language and then can be reused on both iOS and Android mobile platform.
    - React Native offers **cross-platform development** and a real experience to developers allowing them to build only one app with effectively 70% code sharing between different platforms.
    - React Native helps in **faster development.** Building one app instead of two using a common language gives speedier app deployment, delivery, and quicker time-to-market.
    - React Native exists with **essential components** for ending of native apps as the app development ends with native look and feel.
    - React Native has a **large community** of developers for its security. The developers are always ready to fix bugs and issues that occur at any instant. They improve the performance of React Native from time to time with the best practices possible.
    - React Native supports **Live and Hot Reloading.** Both are different features. Live Reloading is a tool that helps in compiling and reading the modified files. Hot Reloading is based on HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and helps to display the updated UI content.

5. ### List the essential components of React Native.

    These are the following essential components of React Native:

    - View is the basic built-in component used to build UI.
    - Text component displays text in the app.
    - Image component displays images in the app.
    - TextInput is used to input text into the app via the keypad.
    - ScrollView is a scrolling container used to host multiple views.

6. ### What are the cons of React Native?

    - React Native is still a new development platform as compared to iOS and Android platforms. It is still immature, i.e., in an improvement stage and impacting negatively on apps.
    - Sometimes, React Native built-in apps face performance problem if there is a requirement of advanced functionality. In that case, they don’t perform well as compared to native apps.
    - React Native has a steep learning curve for an average learner as it is not more comfortable in comparison to other cross-platform apps. It is because of existing JSX (JavaScript Syntax extension) in which HTML and JavaScript get combined and make learning challenging for average ones.
    - React Native is based on JavaScript library which is fragile and creates a gap in the security robustness. As an expert’s point of view, React Native is not secure and robust for building highly confidential data apps like Banking and Financial apps.

7. ### How many threads run in React Native?

    There are two threads run in React Native:

    - JavaScript thread
    - Main UI thread

8. ### What are props in React Native?

    props pronounced as the properties of React Native Components. props are the immutable parameters passed in Presentational Component to provide data.

9. ### What are React Native Apps?

    React Native Apps are not web apps; they are the real and native mobile applications built-in a single language with the native components to run on mobile devices.
